###Description  
This R package, **fwoxy**, is a simple forward model of an idealized estuarine dissolved oxygen time series and the resulting net ecosystem metabolism, i.e. gross primary productivity, ecosystem respiration, and air-sea gas exchange. The primary use of this model is meant to be as a lab component for a marine biogeochemistry course to further understanding of biogeochemical and physical processes that influence estuary metabolism.  

####Functions  
There are six functions included in this package:  
1. fun_density.R -   
2. fun_eqb_oxygen.R -   
3. fun_gas_transfer_velocity.R -   
4. fun_par_sin_model.R -   
5. fun_schmidt_oxygen.R -   
6. fwoxy.R - The main function which sources the prior listed functions and runs the model.
