#fwoxy  

####Description  
The R package **fwoxy** is a forward model of an idealized dissolved oxygen timeseries which can bs used to understand estuarine net ecosystem metabolism. The purpose of this particular forward model is to be used as a lab component to futher understanding of estuarine biogeochemical processes.  

####Functions  
Included in this package are six functions:  
1. fwoxy.R - The main function. All other functions are sourced through fwoxy.R.  
2. fun_density.R - Estimates density of the water.  
3. fun_eqb_oxygen.R -
